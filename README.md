# Blade

A neural chess engine written in Zig using my ML framework [grads](https://github.com/DatoXx8/grads). It is a recreational project.

## Progress / TODOs

1. Finish cgrad (On hold until this one is done)
2. Make chess bindings for the NNs
3. Implement self play
4. Train some (hopefully) strong agents
