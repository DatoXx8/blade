# Blade

A neural chess engine using a custom neural net framework written in C and OpenCL

## Progress / TODOs

1. Implement computing the neural nets on the GPU via OpenCL.
2. Optimise the code to the highest degree I can (both the chess and nn code).
3. Implement UCI such that this can be used with programs like Cutechess.
4. Test a lot of different techniques to train a hopefully strong agent.
